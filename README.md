# GUCera
GUCera is an online learning platform accessed by instructors and students.
You can find user login, instructors and students registeration and all functionalities concerning the instructors (the rest of the website was done by the rest of my team).
The front end of the project was done entirely using ASP.NET communicating with a database which was done using MSSQL (files can be found under Database folder)
